	  PCIe controller is in endpoint mode.
	  It supports the APIs to clients as a service layer, and allows
	  clients to enable/disable PCIe link, configure the address
	  mapping for the access to host memory, trigger wake interrupt
	  on host side to wake up host, and trigger MSI to host side.

	  This kernel module is used to interact with PCIe Root complex
	  supporting MHI protocol. MHI is a data transmission protocol
	  involving communication between a host and a device over shared
	  memory. MHI interacts with the IPA for supporting transfers
	  on the HW accelerated channels between Host and device.

	help
	  This kernel module enables communication over a MHI channel for
	  clients by creating a network device. This module interacts
	  with the MHI device driver to send and receive data to/from a
	  host.
